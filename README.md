##Brief

<blockquote>You will create an application to retrieve and save rss feeds into a database. Users should be able to subscribe and manage their accounts, manage the feeds they wants to follow, archive / bookmark / socially publish the posts and define a feed that they follow as public or private on their profile and see other users profiles and feeds. The efficiency of the DB is a primary concern - multiple subscriptions to a single feed should cause it to be stored only once.</blockquote>
