##Brief

<blockquote>

<p>You will create an application to retrieve and save rss feeds into a database. Users should be able to subscribe and manage their accounts, manage the feeds they wants to follow, archive / bookmark / socially publish the posts and define a feed that they follow as public or private on their profile and see other users profiles and feeds. The efficiency of the DB is a primary concern - multiple subscriptions to a single feed should cause it to be stored only once.</p>

<p>All projects need the following deliverables:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sitemap</li>
<li>Trello planning</li>
<li>Wireframes</li>
<li>Model diagrams</li>
<li>User journeys</li>
<li>Regular commits to Git</li>
<li>Working code</li>
<li>Bonus points for HAML :)</li>
<li>And for Tests</li>
</ul>
